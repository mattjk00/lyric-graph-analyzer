Oh look the poison root
Oh look the poison root
Dug it up from the poison tree
Dug it up from the poison tree
Crushed it up and boiled my tea
Crushed it up and boiled my tea
Now I know everything
Now I know everything
Now I know everything
Now I know everything
I'm so proud of you
And everything that you do
Doesn't matter what they say
They ain't worth a dollar in change
Wish I could be strong like you
Wish I had something to prove
Wanna be a star like you
Wanna make something that's true

If I sink
I don't wanna be the one to leave my baby out without no bottle to drink
If I sink
I don't wanna be the one to leave my baby down without no money in her bank

I wanna be a fake like you
Walk around with rocks in my shoes
I just wanna play the game
Big and fat and insane
I'm so proud of you
And everything that you do
Doesn't matter what I said
I'm better off dead

If I sink
I don't wanna be the one to leave my baby out without no bottle to drink
If I sink
I don't wanna be the one to leave my baby down without no money in her bank

If I sink
I don't wanna be the one to leave my baby out without no bottle to drink
If I fuck up
Oooh
Locked up for nothing
Stealing or something
In with this kid who seemed
Normal and quiet
I'm playing poker and
He's two cells over
Cops rush the hall I saw
Blood on the wall

Turns out the kid had a
Few bags of heroin
Deep in his stomach
He swallowed a razor
See I got some stories
Hey why don't you write that
Into a song maybe
Your fans will dig that
Locked up for nothing
Stealing or something
In with this kid who seemed
Normal and quiet
I'm playing poker and
He's two cells over
Cops rush the hall I saw
Blood on the wall

Turns out the kid had a
Few bags of heroin
Deep in his stomach
He swallowed a razor
See I got some stories
Hey why don't you write that
Into a song maybe
Your fans will dig that
Bobby's just a friend of mine
He's on his back
I'm on his mind
He wakes me when he goes to work
His hands are cold
His breath is smoke

I'd leave him for you
If you want me to
I'd leave him for you
If you want me to
I'd leave him for you
If you want me to
I'd leave him for you
If you want me to

Do you forget when we first met
You grabbed my hand
I tore your dress
I felt things I cannot express
But I lost my way
I made my mess

I'd clean it for you
If you want me to
I'd clean it for you
If you want me to
I'd clean it for you
If you want me to
I'd clean it for you
If you want me to

But I know what you're doing
I know what you're doing
I know you
I know you
I do I do I tell you what

I paint pictures of my heart
The colors blue and purple start
To bleed into an endless dark
It's only you it's only you

I'd burn them for you
If you want me to
I'd burn them for you
If you want me to
I'd burn them for you
If you want me to
I'd burn them for you
If you want me to

But I know what you're doing
I know what you're doing
I know you
I know you
I do I do I tell you what
Dirty old pig
He lost his mind
He walked on the outside
He played dumb
He ate his pride
He walked on the outside

No matter what you do
The witch burns you
You think I don't but I always fucking do
Every time you tell me something untrue
Puts a brick in the wall between me and you

I know that you're lying

You think I don't but I always fucking do
Every time you tell me something untrue
Puts a brick in the wall between me and you

I know that you're lying
I
I know that you're lying

You think I don't but I always fucking do
Every time you tell me something untrue
Puts a brick in the wall between me and you

I know that you're lying

You think I don't but I always fucking do
Every time you tell me something untrue
Puts a brick in the wall between me and you

I know that you're lying
I
I know that you're lying
I
I know that you're lying
Sport star
If you want me I'll call
If you want me to fall
I'll fall
My dream
Let me play on your team
I'm clean
Let me tie your Nikes
Holding on for sport star
Let me wear your jersey
If you want to hurt me
Hurt me

I play how I wanna play
I say what I wanna say
I play how I wanna play
I say what I wanna say
I play how I wanna play
I say what I wanna say
I play how I wanna play
I say what I wanna say

Sport star
In the back of my car
Could you hit me too hard?
You're scarred
Sport star
I can hear your echo
Pass go
Driving on my white throne
95 to sport star
If I make it back on
I don't wanna live long
Just strong
All the time
I try to recall
What drove you away from here
What was dream and what was real
Where was I

That day meant nothing to me
A hiccup in my memory
This life will leave you hungry
I am completely guilty
Davey broke the law again
Heard this time he's going to the pen
Guess I didn't need my lunch
Cause I was going to miss him a whole bunch
Maybe he was out of line
But he was still a pretty close friend of mine
Maybe he had hurt me bad
But a brother is a brother and that is that

Mom's in a mood this week
Cause she thinks that her family is going crazy
Guess it started with the baby
She went in for a hug then it bit her on the cheek
That was pretty funny to me
But I guess I should have more sympathy
I never raised a kid
But I bet I'd do a good job if I did

Had a dream about a promised land
Walkin' round with a big gun in my hand
And when I look you in the eye
You're gonna tell me that you love me and hold me tight
Cause you know that I have no fear
Ain't gonna walk into the river and disappear
I'm gonna be a powerful man
Red blood running down the broken sand

I couldn't tell you
What it means to me
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
Saturday
Sunday

Wiping her lips in the
Mirror at lunch
Told teacher felt sick and called
Momma at once
When 'lina got home she ate
Cinnamon buns she ate
Rabbits and cats she ate
Peaches and plums
If I could say I would say
If I could walk away
If I could talk I would talk
I'd walk around the block
Look at the way he walks in
Look how he tucks his shirt in
Let me behave in my way

Don't ask me questions pa
You know I'm a big old fish now
Don't ask me questions pa
You know I'm a big old fish now
You know I'm a big old fish now
You know I'm a big old fish now
You know I'm a big old fish now

Go get your rod
Get my rod
Let's cast em off the dock
I caught a big fat monkey
Look at him squirming and jumping
Kill it in time to prepare
Pull out the bones and hair
Now comes my favorite part

Bubbling in the pot
Are you guilty?
Are you waiting to be found?
Do you think that you'd be happier
With no one else around?
Are you hiding?
Will the trial never come?
Baby, I've got news-

Is the truth trapped
Behind iron lock and key?
Have you buried all the evidence of
What you used to be?
Has the question
Become darker than the answer?
Baby, I've got news-
